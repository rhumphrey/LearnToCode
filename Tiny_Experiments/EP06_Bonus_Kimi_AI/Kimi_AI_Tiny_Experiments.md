# Kimi AI Tiny Experiments: Instruction Sheet

This sheet provides 10 small experiments to explore the capabilities of Kimi AI's web interface. You can copy and paste these prompts directly into the Kimi AI chat window.

## General Instructions

* **Access Kimi AI:** Open your web browser and navigate to the Kimi AI interface.
* **Paste Prompts:** For each experiment, copy the bolded prompt text and any accompanying instructions (like providing an article or code snippet) directly into the Kimi AI input field.
* **Observe and Analyze:** Pay attention to Kimi AI's response. How accurate is it? How creative? Does it follow all instructions and constraints?

## The Experiments

### 1\. Summarization Challenge (Long Context)

**Objective:** Test Kimi AI's ability to process and summarize lengthy text.

**Instructions:**

1. Find a very long article online (e.g., a detailed news report, a scientific paper, or a lengthy blog post).
2. Copy the *entire* text of the article.
3. Paste the text into Kimi AI and then add the following prompt:
    "**Summarize this in 3 bullet points.**"

-----

### 2\. Code Generation (Simple Function)

**Objective:** Evaluate Kimi AI's basic code generation and translation capabilities.

**Instructions:**

1. First, ask: "**Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number, including docstrings and type hints.**"
2. After it provides the Python code, follow up with: "**Now, translate that function into JavaScript.**"

-----

### 3\. Creative Writing Prompt

**Objective:** See how imaginative and coherent Kimi AI's creative writing can be.

**Instructions:**

1. Use this prompt: "**Write a 5-sentence micro-story about a rogue toaster oven that develops sentience and plans to overthrow the kitchen appliances, from its perspective.**"

-----

### 4\. Data Interpretation (Fictional Data)

**Objective:** Test Kimi AI's ability to extract information and make inferences from simple, provided data.

**Instructions:**

1. Provide the fictional data first, then the question:
    "**Here's some sales data: Product A: $1200, Product B: $850, Product C: $2100. Q1 Profit: 15%, Q2 Profit: 20%. Identify the best-selling product and project the Q3 profit if sales increase by 10% and profit margin remains consistent.**"

### 5\. Debugging a Snippet (Pre-made Error)

**Objective:** Check Kimi AI's ability to identify and correct errors in code.

**Instructions:**

1. Take a simple code snippet (e.g., Python or JavaScript) and intentionally introduce a small, subtle bug. For example, in Python:

    ```python
    def calculate_sum(numbers):
        total = 0
        for num in number: # Intentional error: 'number' instead of 'numbers'
            total += num
        return total
    ```

2. Paste your buggy code into Kimi AI and then ask: "**Find and fix the bug in this code: [your buggy code here].**"

-----

### 6\. "What If" Scenario Exploration

**Objective:** Explore Kimi AI's capacity for hypothetical reasoning and impact analysis.

**Instructions:**

1. Use this prompt: "**If humanity suddenly lost all access to the internet, what would be the immediate and long-term societal impacts?**"

-----

### 7\. Recipe Generation (Constraint-Based)

**Objective:** Test Kimi AI's ability to adhere to multiple, specific constraints in its output.

**Instructions:**

1. Ask: "**Generate a recipe for a vegan, gluten-free dessert that uses apples and cinnamon, requires no baking, and takes less than 20 minutes to prepare.**"

-----

### 8\. Concept Explanation (Complex Topic Simplified)

**Objective:** Evaluate Kimi AI's skill in simplifying complex subjects for a lay audience.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a complex concept (e.g., "quantum entanglement," "existentialism," "blockchain technology").
2. Ask: "**Explain [chosen concept] to a 10-year-old in simple terms.**"

-----

### 9\. Rhyming Poem Generator

**Objective:** Test Kimi AI's ability to produce creative text with specific structural requirements.

**Instructions:**

1. Use this prompt: "**Write a four-line rhyming poem about a sleepy cat curled up by a window.**"

-----

### 10\. Brainstorming Alternative Uses

**Objective:** Assess Kimi AI's creativity and "out-of-the-box" thinking.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose an everyday object (e.g., a paperclip, a shoelace, a plastic bottle).
2. Ask: "**Brainstorm 10 unusual or non-standard uses for a [chosen object].**"
