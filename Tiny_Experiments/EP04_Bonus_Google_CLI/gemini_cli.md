# Tiny Experiments with Gemini CLI

## Experiment List

### **Experiment 0: Gemini CLI Setup & First Launch**

**Goal:** Install the Google Gemini CLI and launch it for the first time.

**Steps:**

1. **Prerequisites Check:** Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher is recommended). You can check by opening your terminal and typing:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    If it's not installed or is an older version, download and install it from the official Node.js website.
2. **Installation:** In your terminal, run one of the following commands to install the Gemini CLI. The `npm install -g` command is generally preferred for a global installation, but `npx` works for a quick one-off run.
      * **Global Install (Recommended):**

        ```bash
        npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
        ```

      * **Run Directly (No Global Install):**

        ```bash
        npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
        ```

3. **Launch & Authenticate:** After installation (or if running directly with `npx`), type `gemini` in your terminal and press Enter.

    ```bash
    gemini
    ```

    The CLI will guide you through:
      * Choosing a theme (e.g., light or dark).
      * Logging in with your Google account. This step is crucial as it authenticates your access to the Gemini API, enabling the free tier usage. Follow the on-screen instructions, which will likely involve opening a browser window to complete the sign-in.

**Expected Outcome:** You should see the Gemini CLI prompt (` > `) appear in your terminal, indicating that it's ready for your commands. If you see this, you're successfully set up and ready to proceed with the other experiments\!

### **Experiment 1: Basic Code Generation**

**Goal:** Generate a simple "Hello, World\!" program in a language of your choice.

**Prompt:**

```bash
> Write a "Hello, World!" program in Python.
```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should output the Python code for a "Hello, World\!" program. You can then copy and paste this into a file and run it.

-----

### **Experiment 2: Explain a Code Snippet**

**Goal:** Understand what a small piece of code does.

**Steps:**

1. Create a file named `simple_math.js` with the following content:

    ```javascript
    function calculateArea(radius) {
        const PI = 3.14159;
        return PI * radius * radius;
    }

    let circleRadius = 5;
    let area = calculateArea(circleRadius);
    console.log(`The area of the circle with radius ${circleRadius} is ${area}`);
    ```

2. In the Gemini CLI, use the `@` symbol to reference the file:
    **Prompt:**

    ```bash
    > Explain what the code in @simple_math.js does.
    ```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should provide a clear explanation of the JavaScript code, describing the function's purpose and how it calculates the area of a circle.

-----

### **Experiment 3: Refactor and Improve Code**

**Goal:** Ask Gemini to improve an existing code snippet.

**Steps:**

1. Using the same `simple_math.js` file from Experiment 2.
2. In the Gemini CLI:
    **Prompt:**

    ```bash
    > Refactor the code in @simple_math.js to use Math.PI and make the variable names more descriptive.
    ```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should output a revised version of the JavaScript code, incorporating `Math.PI` and potentially more explicit variable names. It might also explain its changes.

-----

### **Experiment 4: Generate a Bash Script**

**Goal:** Automate a simple file operation using a bash script generated by Gemini.

**Prompt:**

```bash
> Write a bash script that lists all .txt files in the current directory and its subdirectories, then prints their contents to the terminal.
```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should provide a bash script. You can save this script (e.g., `list_txt.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x list_txt.sh`), and then run it (`./list_txt.sh`) to see it in action.

-----

### **Experiment 5: Debug a Simple Error (Simulated)**

**Goal:** See how Gemini helps with debugging by providing a common error.

**Steps:**

1. Create a file named `buggy_python.py` with this intentional error:

    ```python
    def divide_by_zero(num):
        return num / 0

    result = divide_by_zero(10)
    print(result)
    ```

2. In your regular terminal, run `python buggy_python.py` and observe the `ZeroDivisionError`.
3. In the Gemini CLI:
    **Prompt:**

    ```bash
    > I got a ZeroDivisionError when running my Python script. The code is in @buggy_python.py. How can I fix this?
    ```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should identify the division by zero, explain why it's an error, and suggest a fix (e.g., adding error handling or avoiding division by zero).

-----

### **Experiment 6: Summarize Documentation from a URL**

**Goal:** Leverage Gemini's web search capability to summarize online documentation.

**Prompt:**

```bash
> Summarize the key features of the latest version of Node.js from its official documentation. Use Google Search.
```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should use its Google Search tool, find relevant Node.js documentation, and provide a concise summary of its key features.

-----

### **Experiment 7: Generate Unit Tests**

**Goal:** Ask Gemini to write unit tests for a small function.

**Steps:**

1. Create a file named `calculator.py` with a simple function:

    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b
    ```

2. In the Gemini CLI:
    **Prompt:**

    ```bash
    > Write Python unit tests for the functions in @calculator.py using the unittest module.
    ```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should generate a Python file (or output the code directly) with unit tests for the `add` and `subtract` functions.

-----

### **Experiment 8: Content Generation (Non-Code Related)**

**Goal:** Explore Gemini's ability to generate non-code content, showing its versatility.

**Prompt:**

```bash
> Write a short, encouraging message for developers who are just starting out, focusing on the importance of persistence and learning from mistakes.
```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should generate a motivational message or short paragraph. This shows it's not just for code\!

-----

### **Experiment 9: Basic Cloud Deployment Concept (Theoretical)**

**Goal:** Understand how Gemini CLI can assist with cloud deployment, without actually deploying.

**Prompt:**

```bash
> If I wanted to deploy a simple Node.js web application to Google Cloud Run, what steps would I typically follow, and how could the Gemini CLI assist with that?
```

**Expected Outcome:** Gemini CLI should outline the general steps for deploying to Cloud Run (e.g., containerizing, pushing to Artifact Registry, creating a service), and for each step, explain how it could generate commands or configuration files to help.

-----

### **Experiment 10: Interactive Problem Solving**

**Goal:** Have a short, interactive back-and-forth with Gemini to solve a problem.

**Prompt 1:**

```bash
> I need to parse a CSV file in Python. What's the best way to do that?
```

**Expected Outcome 1:** Gemini CLI should suggest using Python's `csv` module and provide a basic example.

**Prompt 2 (follow-up):**

```bash
> Now, how would I filter the rows where a specific column (let's say 'Age') is greater than 30? Assume the CSV has headers.
```

**Expected Outcome 2:** Gemini CLI should adapt the previous example to include logic for filtering based on the 'Age' column, demonstrating its ability to maintain context.
