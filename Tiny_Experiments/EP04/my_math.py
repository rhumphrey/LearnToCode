# --- Qodo Experiment 1: Simple Function Test ---
# Objective: See how Qodo generates basic tests for straightforward functions.
# Steps:
# 1. Open this file in your IDE (e.g., VS Code with Qodo Gen extension installed).
# 2. Place your cursor anywhere inside the 'add' function definition.
# 3. Look for the "Test this function" that Qodo adds above the function. Click it.
# 4. Observe the panel that appears to the left and walk through the 'chat' responding as necessary
# 5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the 'subtract' function below to see more examples.

def subtract(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    """Subtracts y from x and returns the result."""
    return x - y
