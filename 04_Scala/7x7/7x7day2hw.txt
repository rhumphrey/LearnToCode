- What makes a closure different from a code block
    - https://alvinalexander.com/scala/how-to-use-closures-in-scala-fp-examples/
    - In Scala, a closure is a function that can capture the bindings of free variables in its 
      lexical scope, which means it can use and even modify variables defined outside of its 
      immediate function body. On the other hand, a code block is simply a grouping of statements 
      enclosed in braces {} that can contain declarations, expressions, and other blocks, 
      but it does not capture any free variables.
      - Code Block: It’s a syntactic structure that groups statements together. 
        For example, the body of a while statement is a code block. It allows for local scoping of 
        variables, meaning variables declared within a block are not accessible outside of it.
      - Closure: A closure is a special type of function that captures the state of the environment 
        when it’s created. This means it can reference variables from its surrounding scope, 
        even if they’re not passed as parameters. Closures are useful because they carry the context 
        with them, allowing for more flexible and functional programming patterns.

Do:
1. Use foldLeft to compute the total size of a list of strings.
2. Write a Censor trait with a method that will replace the curse words Shoot and Darn with Pucky and Beans alternatives. 
   Use a map to store the curse words and their alternatives.
3. Load the curse words and alternatives from a file.
