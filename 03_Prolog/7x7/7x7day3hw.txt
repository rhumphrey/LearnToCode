Day 3 - Self-Study (Homework)
Find:
- Prolog has some input/output features as well. Find print predicates that print out variables.
- Find a way to use the print predicates to print only successful solutions. How do they work?
Do:
1. Modify the Sudoku solver to work on six-by-six puzzles (squares are 3x2) and 9x9 puzzles.
2 Make the Sudoku solver print prettier solutions.
If you’re a puzzle enthusiast, you can get lost in Prolog. If you want to dive deeper into the puzzles I’ve presented, Eight Queens is a good
place to start.
3. Solve the Eight Queens problem by taking a list of queens. Rather than a tuple, represent each queen with an integer, from 1–8. 
   Get the row of a queen by its position in the list and the column by the value in the list.
