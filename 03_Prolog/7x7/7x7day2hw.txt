Day 2 - Self-Study (Homework)
Find:
- Some implementations of a Fibonacci series and factorials. How do they work?
- A real-world community using Prolog. What problems are they solving with it today?
If you’re looking for something more advanced to sink your teeth into, try these problems:
- An implementation of the Towers of Hanoi. How does it work?
- What are some of the problems of dealing with “not” expressions? Why do you have to be careful with negation in Prolog?
Do:
1. Reverse the elements of a list.
2. Find the smallest element of a list.
3. Sort the elements of a list.
