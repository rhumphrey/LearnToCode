Find:
- Prolog has some input/output features as well. Find print predicates that print out variables.

Do:
1. Modify the Sudoku solver to work on six-by-six puzzles (squares are 3x2) and 9x9 puzzles.
2 Make the Sudoku solver print prettier solutions.
If you’re a puzzle enthusiast, you can get lost in Prolog. If you want to dive deeper into the puzzles I’ve presented, Eight Queens is a good
place to start.
3. Solve the Eight Queens problem by taking a list of queens. Rather than a tuple, represent each queen with an integer, from 1–8. 
   - Get the row of a queen by its position in the list and the column by the value in the list.

[facts and rules] = sudoku4_var1.pl
[facts and rules] = sudoku4_var2.pl

[facts and rules] = sudoku4_var3.pl

3. Solve the Eight Queens problem by taking a list of queens. Rather than a tuple, represent each queen with an integer, from 1–8. 
   - Get the row of a queen by its position in the list and the column by the value in the list.
[facts and rules] = queens_var1.pl (list)
[facts and rules] = queens_var2.pl (no list)
