Experiment: Pick a task, like summarizing a paragraph of text or solving a simple logic puzzle. Try solving it with different prompting methods on the same model:
- Zero-shot: Just ask the question directly.
- Few-shot: Provide 1-3 examples of the task and the desired output before asking your actual question.
- Chain-of-Thought: Add "Let's think step-by-step" to your prompt before the model responds, especially for reasoning tasks.
Observe: Does providing examples improve accuracy? Does asking the model to "think step-by-step" lead to better reasoning or problem-solving for logic puzzles?
