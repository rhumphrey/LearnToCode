    "    'The Halifax Explosion was a disaster that occurred in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on the morning of 6 December 1917. It began when the French cargo ship SS Mont-Blanc, carrying a large cargo of wartime explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, the strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the Mont-Blanc ignited her highly volatile cargo, causing a massive explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax. Approximately 2,000 people were killed, and an estimated 9,000 others were injured. It remains the largest human-made explosion in history before the development of nuclear weapons.\n",
    "    The force of the explosion was immense. Ships were thrown ashore, buildings were demolished, and a powerful tsunami-like wave washed over the city. The blast was heard as far away as Prince Edward Island, over 200 kilometres (120 mi) away. A thick cloud of white smoke rose to a height of over 3,600 metres (11,800 ft).\n",
    "    Relief efforts began almost immediately, with survivors digging out victims from the rubble. Help poured in from across Canada and the United States. Medical personnel and supplies were dispatched to Halifax, and temporary shelters were set up for the thousands left homeless. The disaster had a profound and lasting impact on the city, leading to significant changes in building codes and harbour regulations. The annual Boston Christmas Tree, a tradition that continues to this day, was established as a symbol of gratitude for the aid provided by Boston and the state of Massachusetts in the aftermath of the explosion.'\n",
